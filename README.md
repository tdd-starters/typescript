# TypeScript TDD Starter
A sample project for getting started with TDD in TypeScript.

The file _\_\_tests\_\_/capitalize_test.ts contains one test case and a few in comments.
Start by coming up with a few test cases and add them to the lists,
then implement them one at a time,
test-driving the solution forwards.

Uses Yarn for the build system and Jest as the test runner.

First install all dependencies with
```shell
yarn install
```

Then, run the tests with:

```shell
yarn test
```
